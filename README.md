# Text Clustering Based on Spark.MLlib's LDA

### Overview
Traditional text clustering model has sparse high-dimension problem, and it's lack of semantic understanding. To solve above problems, here it proposes a based on the Spark.MLlib's LDA (LatentDirichlet Allocation) model, using the Gibbs algorithm to estimate probability distribution, then clustering by K-means clustering method. Experiment shows that the method is effective.
